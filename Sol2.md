In this task is used backtracking approach. firstly, array is sorted and we skip simular numbers in every variant to avoid diplicates (in example fistly we made variant with 11 after that we make a variant with one 1 and skip all solutions until we meet the next number - that is why we sorted array). After that we just make dfs and if we achieved our target - we add it to our result list.
